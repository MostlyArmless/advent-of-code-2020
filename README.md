# advent-of-code-2020

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems.

## Setup

1. Clone repo `git clone git@github.com:MostlyArmless/advent-of-code-2020.git`
2. Install dependencies `npm install`

## Usage

`npm start` runs `/src/main.ts` which will solve each problem and print the solution

## Tests

To run the tests, either use `npm test` to run all the tests, or configure VS Code's Mocha Test Explorer extension to look for files with the pattern `test/*spec.ts`, and then you can run individual tests from the Test Explorer.
